# MTA v7.x Workflow

Migration Toolkit for Application Analysis (MTA) v7.x workflow evaluates applications to determine potential risks and the associated costs of containerizing the applications. It uses the [MTA v7.x Operator](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/migration_toolkit_for_applications/7.0/html/introduction_to_the_migration_toolkit_for_applications/index) to perform the analysis.
At the end of a successful assessment workflow, a link to the report will be available in Backstage, under the notifications plugin.

**Note**: The *MTA* workflow type functions as an assessment tool, evaluating the provided code repository and suggesting the next workflow to execute for that repository. Currently, there is a correlation between the *MTA* and *Move2Kube* workflow, where *Move2Kube* is recommended by the *MTA*. Consequently, it is necessary to install both to leverage their benefits fully.

## Configuration
View the [MTA v7.X README on GitHub](https://github.com/rhdhorchestrator/serverless-workflows-config/blob/main/charts/mta-v7.x/README.md)

## Installation
- Run
```console
helm repo add orchestrator-workflows https://rhdhorchestrator/serverless-workflows-config
helm install mta orchestrator-workflows/mta-v7 -n sonataflow-infra
```

## Post-installation
### Set up the MTA instance with a Jira Connection
Define a Jira instance in MTA and establish a connection to it, by following the [Creating and configuring a Jira connection](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/migration_toolkit_for_applications/7.0/html/user_interface_guide/creating-configuring-jira-connection#doc-wrapper) guide.

### Edit the `${WORKFLOW_NAME}-creds` Secret
The token for sending notifications from the MTA-v7.x workflow to RHDH notifications service needs to be provided to the workflow.

Edit the secret `${WORKFLOW_NAME}-creds` and set the value of `NOTIFICATIONS_BEARER_TOKEN`:
```
WORKFLOW_NAME=mta-analysis-v7
oc -n sonataflow-infra patch secret "${WORKFLOW_NAME}-creds" --type merge -p '{"data": { "NOTIFICATIONS_BEARER_TOKEN": "'$(oc get secrets -n rhdh-operator backstage-backend-auth-secret -o go-template='{{ .data.BACKEND_SECRET  }}')'"}}'
```

This secret is used in the `sonataflow` CR to inject the token as an environment variable that will be used by the workflow.

Once the secret is updated, to have it applied, the pod shall be restarted.
Note that the modification of the secret does not currently restart the pod, the action shall be performed manually or, if you are following the next section, any change to the sonataflow CR will restart the pod.

Note that if you run the `helm upgrade` command, the values of the secret are reseted.

### Edit the `mta-analysis-v7` Sontaflow CR:

There is one variable required to be set in the `mta-analysis-v7-props` ConfigMap:
* **mta.url** - The URL to the MTA application

We will not set this value directly as quarkus will first try to expand the value of `MTA_URL` to set its value. Isntead, we will set the environment variable in the `mta-analysis-v7` Sontaflow CR:
- **Please note** that it may take several minutes for the MTA Operator to become available and for the route to be reachable.
```console
while [[ $retry_count -lt 5 ]]; do
    oc -n openshift-mta get route mta && break || sleep 60
    retry_count=$((retry_count + 1))
done
MTA_ROUTE=$(oc -n openshift-mta get route mta -o yaml | yq -r .spec.host)
oc -n ${TARGET_NS} patch sonataflow mta-analysis-v7 --type merge -p '{"spec": { "podTemplate": { "container": { "env": [{"name": "MTA_URL", "value": "https://'${MTA_ROUTE}'"}]}}}}'
```

### Validate instalation

- Verify MTA resources and workflow are ready:
```console
sleep 120s # to wait until the MTA operator has created all requested resources
oc wait --for=jsonpath='{.status.phase}=Succeeded' -n openshift-mta csv/mta-operator.v7.0.3 --timeout=2m
oc wait --for=condition=Ready=true pods -l "app.kubernetes.io/name=mta-ui" -n openshift-mta --timeout=2m
oc wait -n sonataflow-infra sonataflow/mta-analysis-v7 --for=condition=Running --timeout=2m
```
